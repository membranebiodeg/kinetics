# Kinetic Study of Membrane Biodegradation in Soil
MATLAB codes and experimental data used for kinetic study of the membrane biodegradation can be found in this repository.

Eight kinetic models are used: First order, Dual First Order in Parallel (DFOP), First Order Two Compartment (FOTC), Carbon, Logistics, Modified Gompertz, Michaelis Menten and Third Half Order (THO).

Function files:
- objf_calib.m
- calib_CT.m
- simple_constraint.m (used if there are constraints for the unknown constants)
- michaelismenten.m

Note: The names of the function file in each of the folder are the same with the equations and constraints adjusted according to the model being studied.
